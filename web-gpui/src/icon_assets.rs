//! Embedded icon assets for the browser build.
//!
//! GPUI renders `IconName`s through an `AssetSource`; on native the desktop
//! app registers `gpui_kit::assets::Assets` (which embeds this same default
//! icon set on disk-backed builds), while the wasm variant of that crate only
//! offers an on-demand CDN fetch. To keep the payload self-contained (the
//! daemon may run offline), `build.rs` embeds the vendored SVGs from
//! `assets/icons/` — the same default component set gpui-kit ships natively.
